# Stage D Continuity Handoff — 2026-11-01

Resume from `tmp/d1-rebuild-20261101` after re-fetching its live HEAD and current Actions run status.

D1 source modules and tests were reimplemented from the pinned GitHub artifacts and D1 specification. The importer was not run. Local compileall passed and 19 tests passed. Builder integration produced 125 role assignments, 105 unique keys and 105 records (100 S6 + 5 C100). All 105 normalized manifest states remain `NOT_VERIFIED`.

Run `41243585213` failed at artifact download with HTTP 401 because the API Authorization header was forwarded through a temporary redirect. Workflow correction commit: `6365789e061e59e48795bdb8fcbdf8ebe93d3d3f`. Check follow-up run `41243650394` before proceeding.

Remaining D1 requirements: successful exact-head workflow; remote readback URL + SHA-256 + blob SHA-1 + containing commit for every required file; complete normative v2.4.0 reference published at its approved digest. D2 is not started. No Trial, simulation, Monte Carlo, N=4800, PR, merge, Release or main update.

## Corrective live-session record — 2026-11-01T23:55Z

- Live starting HEAD for this correction: `d82016eca2d14a4526054313b05172d64f125729`; main remained `c6e54349a5e94f65d5aa9f83141f225d777bb474`.
- The incomplete warning-only file `tmp/reference-payload/part-00.txt` was deleted through GitHub Contents API. Deletion commit: `963877dd3cf7741552be28839eaab4cc3db0af20`; prior blob: `6be0ca385846fee473dbc1f85b9996d06c603048`. A subsequent branch read returned 404 for that path.
- Exact-head workflow [41254456000](https://github.com/yasmin977209-ux/motorcycle-simulation/actions/runs/41254456000) completed SUCCESS on `963877dd3cf7741552be28839eaab4cc3db0af20`. Job `d1-source` passed all steps; 26 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; three pinned historical artifacts passed size/SHA-256 verification; Parquet integration and exact-live-head assertion passed. The run produced zero uploaded artifacts.
- The v2.4.0 archive member was extracted locally from the already-uploaded ZIP and CRC-checked: 401,397 bytes; ZIP CRC `0xe0be9520`; SHA-256 `225de838d35d6ed383886bf8d0dbe104a6f3d7c72baa6eac5d15e352f4652c0b`. Classification: `VERIFIED_LOCAL` only.
- Canonical remote path `docs/governance/MOTORCYCLE_SIMULATION_GOVERNING_REFERENCE_V2.4.0.md` remains unpublished. No content-bearing GitHub write request was made because the local archive bytes are not available inside the GitHub connector execution context, while its Git Data/Contents write actions require the complete content string. The available tools expose no GraphQL createCommitOnBranch or workflow-dispatch action accepting this local file reference; the existing validation workflow has read-only contents permission and no base64 publication input. Therefore publication remains `CANNOT_PUBLISH / MISSING_EVIDENCE`, not `VERIFIED_LIVE`.
- No v2.4.0 remote blob, raw-byte SHA-256, or containing commit exists to report. Do not infer remote publication from the local digest.
- No D2 registry, importer, Trial, Simulation, Monte Carlo, N=4800, PR, merge, Release, or main update was performed. D1 remains BLOCKED solely on canonical reference publication and remote triple evidence.


## Latest live handoff — 2026-11-01T00:16Z

Resume only after re-reading live refs. Current reviewed branch HEAD: `c84da4611eee677dfc7cf381c3f831be09a01308`; `main`: `c6e54349a5e94f65d5aa9f83141f225d777bb474`.

Run `41255932373` passed on the exact current HEAD (26 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; pinned artifact hashes and Parquet LossCase/MaxCase integration passed; exact-head assertion passed). The publisher workflow `.github/workflows/publish-v2.4.0-reference.yml` is prepared but NOT_RUN because no transfer payload/READY marker exists. Canonical v2.4.0 reference is still absent remotely; local ZIP member remains VERIFIED_LOCAL only (401,397 bytes; SHA-256 `225de838d35d6ed383886bf8d0dbe104a6f3d7c72baa6eac5d15e352f4652c0b`).

D1 remains BLOCKED solely on this publication and remote triple. D2 remains NOT_STARTED. Do not run importer, Trials, Simulation, Monte Carlo or N=4800. Do not touch main, merge, PR or Release. Preserve 105/105 NOT_VERIFIED manifest states and C100 Golden revalidation NOT_RUN.

State files are root `state.json` and `docs/STATE_SHA_SEMANTICS.md`; the root state is a historical Stage 12 snapshot, not the current D1 status. Do not infer branch HEAD from `state.sha`.


## Prompt-library update — 2026-11-01T14:37Z (append-only)

- Created the consolidated Arabic GitHub-first prompt library at [docs/stage_d/PROJECT_PROMPT_LIBRARY_AR_2026-11-01.md](stage_d/PROJECT_PROMPT_LIBRARY_AR_2026-11-01.md).
- Prompt-library commit: e9af9d4329216909120f67d406ddecc939237ee2; Git blob SHA-1: 197ff616521deea3a812067df2a971b8a985173a; size: 58,572 bytes; SHA-256 from GitHub Raw bytes: 38f7c7744f171b80203d253c4f769be509f12e56abae56ed24b4eaa35feb1468.
- The library reflects the live baseline at its creation: D0 COMPLETE / PASS_SCOPED_WITH_LIMITATIONS; D1 PASS_SCOPED_WITH_LIMITATIONS; D2 NOT_STARTED. It preserves all known D1 limitations and does not authorize new Trials, Simulation, Monte Carlo, N=4800, main changes, merges or Releases.
- Live branch HEAD at this append's parent was e9af9d4329216909120f67d406ddecc939237ee2; main remained c6e54349a5e94f65d5aa9f83141f225d777bb474. The source-validation workflow ran successfully on the prompt-library commit (Run 41317106574; exact tested SHA e9af9d4329216909120f67d406ddecc939237ee2); the follow-up documentation commit requires its own exact-head validation.
- This is a documentation-only continuity update. No phase was started or re-opened, and no project acceptance or gate status was promoted.
